# Logic Simulatior App

## Goal
The aim of our project is to design a logic simulator. The logic network is defined by a circuit definition text file which is to be uploaded by the user. A detailed specification for the language of the circuit definition, using the Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF) notation, has also been provided.
